Special procedure have been developed to deal effectively with these problems. The discrete coalescence/breakup equation has been solved using the Low and List breakup formulation and the earlier List and Gillespie formulation. Comparison shows that the Low and List model solutions approach equilibrium more slowly than do the earlier model solutions; moreover, the Low and List equilibrium drop spectra exhibit a bimodality in the small-drop end of the spectrum. The longer time constants associated with the Low and List equations ease somewhat the severe computational stability problem associated with List and Gillespie equations.},

The optical arrangement, which is similar to a dual-scatter laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV), consists of two laser beams focused to a crossover region. Droplets passing through the focal volume scatter light to the collecting lens situated at some off-axis angle. The dual-beam light scatter is analyzed by the geometric optics theory to relate the scattered fringe pattern to the droplet diameter. Because the droplet size measurement is based on the relative phase shift between the two light waves passing through it, the method is independent of the incident intensity, droplet absorption, or absolute scattering intensity. Experimental measurements of monodisperse droplet streams show good agreement with the theory. The technique can be applied to spray-droplet measurements over the size range of 3 μm to 5 mm. By using large off-axis scatter detection angles, the measurement of the droplet size and velocity distributions in relatively dense spray environments is made possible.},

	abstract = {Abstract Four raindrop distributions at equilibrium are studied using a Markov chain model adapted from the cloud parcel model of Young. The model uses collisional drop breakup as specified by Low and List. The shape of the equilibrium distributions is determined by the birth and death fluxes of drops, the expected lifetimes of the drops, and at diameters greater than 1.5 mm, by the net flux of drops from size to size. The shape of the distributions is sensitive to the fraction of mass lost by the colliding drops in sheet breakup.A proposition inspired by Marshall and Palmer, that exponential spectra result from increasing chances of drop identity loss with increasing diameter, is found to be incomplete. Of greater importance is an exponential decrease with diameter of drop births. A constant N0 among observed raindrop distributions may result from the different stage of evolution each distribution represents. At low liquid-water contents (LWCs), distributions are far from equilibrium and reflect the cloud environment (large N0). At low LWCs, N0 will be inversely proportional to rain intensity. At higher LWCs, distributions are closer to equilibrium, where N0 is proportional to LWC. The decline of N0 with higher LWCs may match the increase of N0 resulting with greater maturity, creating the appearance of a constant N0. Due to the extreme times and LWCs required, raindrop distributions will never achieve complete equilibrium. Difficulties with the Low and List parameterizations strongly suggest their usefulness may be limited.},

Three average relationship curves are proposed respectively for dense haze, “dry and cold” fog and “wet and warm” fog.

	abstract = {Abstract Raindrop size distributions are often assumed to follow a three-parameter gamma distribution. Since rain intensity retrieval from radar observations is an underdetermined problem, there is great interest in finding physical correlations between the parameters of the gamma distribution. One of the more common approaches is to measure naturally occurring drop size distributions (DSDs) using a disdrometer and to find DSD parameters by fitting a gamma distribution to these observations. Often the method of moments is used to retrieve the parameters of a gamma distribution from disdrometer observations. In this work the effect of the method of moments and data filtering on the relation between the parameters of the DSD is investigated, namely, the shape μ and the slope Λ parameters. For this study the disdrometer observations were simulated. In these simulations the gamma distribution parameters Nw, D0, and μ were randomly selected from a wide range of values that are found in rainfall. Then, using simulated disdrometer measurements, DSD parameters were estimated using the method of moments. It is shown that the statistical errors associated with data filtering of disdrometer measurements might produce a spurious relation between μ and Λ parameters. It is also shown that three independent disdrometer measurements can be used to verify the existence of such a relation.},

	abstract = {Abstract Understanding drop size distribution (DSD) variability has important implications for remote sensing and numerical modeling applications. Twelve disdrometer datasets across three latitude bands are analyzed in this study, spanning a broad range of precipitation regimes: light rain, orographic, deep convective, organized midlatitude, and tropical oceanic. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reveal comprehensive modes of global DSD spatial and temporal variability. Although the locations contain different distributions of individual DSD parameters, all locations are found to have the same modes of variability. Based on PCA, six groups of points with unique DSD characteristics emerge. The physical processes that underpin these groups are revealed through supporting radar observations. Group 1 (group 2) is characterized by high (low) liquid water content (LWC), broad (narrow) distribution widths, and large (small) median drop diameters D0. Radar analysis identifies group 1 (group 2) as convective (stratiform) rainfall. Group 3 is characterized by weak, shallow radar echoes and large concentrations of small drops, indicative of warm rain showers. Group 4 identifies heavy stratiform precipitation. The low latitudes exhibit distinct bimodal distributions of the normalized intercept parameter Nw, LWC, and D0 and are found to have a clustering of points (group 5) with high rain rates, large Nw, and moderate D0, a signature of robust warm rain processes. A distinct group associated with ice-based convection (group 6) emerges in the midlatitudes. Although all locations exhibit the same covariance of parameters associated with these groups, it is likely that the physical processes responsible for shaping the DSDs vary as a function of location.},

Given the lack of studies on the DSD at mid-latitudes, the present work focuses on the microphysical characterization of precipitation events occurring in Italy, using two different types of disdrometer. A large number of different rain events was collected: they underwent microphysical analysis by computing the Z-R relationships, observing the average DSDs and DSD parameters, fitting the real distribution for different rainfall rate categories and applying convective (C) \&ndash; stratiform (S) discrimination algorithms. A general agreement with past works at mid-latitudes is found both in the Z-R relationship and in DSD parameters. The rain distribution is well described by a gamma DSD and only in some cases (especially the light rain events) by an exponential DSD. Marked differences are observed in DSD parameters and Z-R relationships between C and S episodes. The use of disdrometers for areas covered by multiparametric radar is suggested and will be performed in the near future.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This paper presents an analysis of the modified Gamma model which is used to represent the cloud DSD. The analysis of the DSD is conducted through the derivation of the distribution moments and their physical interpretation. The analysis includes the discussion of the mean, variance, effective radius, and effective variance of the DSD. Usually the effective radius is extracted from radiance measurements. However, since the modified Gamma distribution has two parameters it requires estimates of both the effective radius and effective variance to properly estimate cloud microphysics from radiance},

	abstract = {Abstract The evolution of raindrop spectra by collisional breakup is examined analytically and modelled in box and 1-dimensional shaft models, using the parameterization of Low and List. The significant analytical result shows that equilibrium drop size distributions occur in families that are multiples of one another: fDRRD where D is the drop diameter, R is the rainfall rate, f(D,R) the number density distribution in terms of D and R and ψ is a shape function. For the Low-List breakup scheme the shapes are trimodal, with peaks in the number distributions at diameters of 264, 790, and 1760 μm. Similar structures were found by Valdez and Young, and Brown for box models. These peaks are expected to exist wherever spectra approach equilibrium, independently of the rainfall rate. In this paper the development of these peaks from non-equilibrium spectra is examined, together with the effect of periodically varying rainfall rates. In box and one-dimensional shaft models, nonequilibrium spectra quickly develop features similar to those at equilibrium, but times and/or heights to reach true equilibrium are in excess of 30 minutes, or 3 km for all but the very heaviest rainfall rates. The peaks, however, should be identifiable in a matter of minutes, thus encouraging field verification under favorable conditions. In the absence of evaporation, spectral evolution below a cloud is dominated by the large drops, which produce the accompanying small drops by breakup. Evaporation, while basically affecting the smallest drops, is quickly spread over the whole spectrum by the collision process and reduces the total liquid water content The drop spectrum shape however, remains unchanged.},

	abstract = {Abstract Using results of laboratory experiments on collision-induced raindrop breakup, Low and List (LL) developed a parameterization describing the fragment size distribution (FSD) produced by collisions of raindrops. An equilibrium raindrop size distribution (ED) is approached when this parameterization is used in numerical models of steady rain. Since scant observational evidence of such EDs exists, the need for a careful examination of the parameterization's foundation is evident. Using LL's experimental observations, an alternate parameterization is developed that alleviates three shortcomings of the original scheme, namely, ensuring mass conservation, the use of adequate uncertainty analysis, and the use of a more physical basis for deriving parameterized relationships. FSDs generated by raindrop collisions are represented by combinations of lognormal, Gaussian, and modified delta distributions for each of the three breakup types (filament, sheet, and disk) observed. The mode, width, and height of these distributions are calculated for the 10 colliding drop size combinations used in the LL experiments; uncertainty estimates for these parameters are determined using a bootstrap method, a technique that randomly chooses results of individual collisions. Relations giving the mode, width, and height in terms of the diameters of arbitrary large and small colliding raindrops are then determined so that the FSD from any raindrop collision can be predicted. Simulations with a time-dependent box model are conducted using an exponential Marshall–Palmer distribution, with a rain rate R of 54 mm h−1 as input. A bimodal ED, with peaks at 0.26 and 2.3 mm, is approached numerically from the opposing forces of coalescence and breakup. The nature of the ED differs from that found in previous studies using the LL parameterization, which had three peaks at diameters of 0.26, 0.91, and 1.8 mm. Simulations that produced EDs from consideration of only specific breakup types showed that filament breakups were mainly responsible for the production of the peak at 0.26 mm, and that the small drop peaks associated with sheet and disk breakup had too small of an amplitude compared to the small drop peak produced by filament breakup and occurred at diameters separated too far from each other to produce a third peak in the ED generated from all breakup types acting simultaneously. There are substantial differences in total number of raindrops, N, for the ED associated with this parameterization (8.6 × 103 m−3) to the N associated with that of LL (4.1 × 103 m−3); however, differences in R (51.1– 50.5 mm h−1) and radar reflectivity factor, Z (4.7 × 104 cf. 3.5 × 104 mm6 m−3), are less significant. Large differences between Z and N values associated with the Marshall–Palmer distribution (8.0 × 104 mm6 m−3 and 4.0 × 103 m−3) also exist. Bimodal distributions with peaks at 0.26 and 2.3 mm are consistently realized in a series of Monte Carlo simulations, where fit coefficients are randomly chosen from the surface of equally realizable solutions, but the height of the small drop peak can vary from 5.1 × 103 to 1.2 × 104 m−3 per logarithmic coordinate, and that of the large drop peak from 4.2 × 102 to 6.7 × 102 m−3 per logarithmic coordinate. Although N can vary from 6.2 × 103 to 1.1 × 104 m−3 between simulations, variations in R (48.4 to 53.1 mm h−1) and Z (4.1 × 104 to 5.5 × 104 mm6 m−3) are less significant. These results hence place a limit on the certainty with which the collision-induced breakup of raindrops can be predicted.},

	abstract = {Quantitative measurement, estimation, and prediction of precipitation remains one of the grand challenges in the hydrological and atmospheric sciences with far-reaching implications across the natural sciences. Although the roots of current research activity in this topic go back to the beginning of the twentieth century, advances in radar technology and in numerical modeling have provided the impetus for prolific research in the area of cloud and precipitation physics over the last 50 years. As radar rainfall measurements progressively became the staple of hydrometeorological observing systems, cloud and precipitation microphysics emerged as increasingly preeminent areas of research. Here we present a synthesis of the state of the science with respect to the physical dynamics of hydrometeors and, specifically, the transient processes that affect the temporal evolution of rainfall microstructure and that are directly relevant to the quantitative interpretation of radar rainfall measurements and explicit numerical simulations. The focus of our survey is on raindrop morphodynamics (equilibrium raindrop shape and raindrop oscillations), drop-drop interactions (bounce, coalescence, and breakup), and the dynamical evolution of raindrop size distributions in precipitating clouds.},

Such peaks may represent important clues for investigations into precipitation growth and binary interaction mechanisms of raindrops.

	abstract = {Abstract The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of a new parameterization of drop–drop collision outcomes based on the relationship between Weber number and drop diameter ratios on the dynamical simulation of raindrop size distributions. Results of the simulations with the new parameterization are compared with those of the classical parameterizations. Comparison with previous results indicates on average an increase of 70\% in the drop number concentration and a 15\% decrease in rain intensity for the equilibrium drop size distribution (DSD). Furthermore, the drop bounce process is parameterized as a function of drop size based on laboratory experiments for the first time in a microphysical model. Numerical results indicate that drop bounce has a strong influence on the equilibrium DSD, in particular for very small drops ({\textless}0.5 mm), leading to an increase of up to 150\% in the small drop number concentration (left-hand side of the DSD) when compared to previous modeling results without accounting for bounce effects.},

	abstract = {Abstract Equilibrium raindrop size distributions with three peaks in number concentration (3PED) result from different breakup types and coalescences. Filament breakup produces drops in the small-drop peak of the 3PED and sheet breakup in the medium-drop peak, while disk breakup does not significantly affect the 3PED. Drops in the large-drop peak are produced by all types of interaction. A forty-dimensional phase space for number concentration, each dimension representing a different drop size, shows how equilibrium is approached and maintained. When reduced to seven dimensions, the complex processes of moving drops in and out of the peaks at equilibrium are clearly identified. Small drops are lost by coalescence, and filament breakup is the major sink of medium drops. The introduction of a measure for the difference between two spectra, the metric, shows that, starting from a Marshall–Palmer distribution with a rainrate of 54 mm h−1, the distribution moved farther away from the 3PED between 120 s and 350 s before approaching the 3PED continuously. A three-dimensional model, the diameter ranges under the peaks being the dimensions, shows that this occurs because many small drops are produced by filament breakup replacing the initial deficit of small drops with a surplus, which subsequently is depleted. There is no evidence for any oscillation of the raindrop spectra about its equilibrium value. It appears that a significant population of both 1 mm and 2 mm drops are needed before a 3PED can occur, but a 3PED can be safely assumed to develop once they are present.},
